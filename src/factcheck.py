"""Module 11 — Fact check (independent post-write verification).

Contract:
    what it does : re-checks a FINISHED script against live web search + its own sources, grades
                   what it finds, and blocks the reel only on a fabrication-grade problem.
    input        : script_body (str), sources (list[str]), optional title.
    output       : {"ok": bool, "unsupported": list[str], "minor": list[str], "checked": int,
                    "reason": str}   ("unsupported" = the BLOCKING findings; "minor" = waived)
    depends on   : src.llm (Gemini grounded search), src.config.

Why this exists. The scriptwriter already writes with grounding, but that is the SAME pass that
invents the framing — a model marking its own homework in the same breath. Since the operator
moved the channel from neutral explainer to truth-first commentary (2026-07-27), the script may
now reach a verdict and name who is responsible. That freedom is only safe if the underlying
facts are load-bearing, so verification stops being advisory and becomes a gate: accuracy is the
monetization gate (rule 6), and a strike costs far more than a skipped reel.

Deliberately a SEPARATE pass with a different prompt, so the check is adversarial rather than
self-confirming: it is told to assume nothing from the script.

SEVERITY GRADING (operator directive, 2026-08-07). The first version treated every discrepancy as
fatal — including rounding, a date off by a day, a figure two sources count differently, and
anything one search pass simply failed to surface ("absence of evidence is failure"). In practice
that blocked most ideas over differences that changed nothing, which is its own failure mode: a
gate that stops everything protects nothing, it just stops the channel. So findings are now sorted
into two buckets and only the first one blocks:

  · blocking — the story is FALSE: the event didn't happen, a named party is blamed for something
    they didn't do, an invented quote/law/ruling/statistic, a number wrong enough to flip the
    conclusion, or a blame claim no source supports at all.
  · minor    — the story is TRUE but imprecise: rounding, a slightly different figure, wording,
    emphasis, or something simply not confirmed by this pass.

Two rules do most of the work, and both come straight from the operator's reasoning:
  · CONTRADICTION blocks; NON-CONFIRMATION does not. One grounded pass missing a real story is
    routine, and "I couldn't find it" is not evidence that it is false.
  · Two sources disagreeing is not proof the script is wrong. Both can be wrong, both can be
    right, or they can be measuring different things. Only the WEIGHT of evidence blocks.

This loosens precision, NOT the anti-fabrication spine — rule 6's trade ("the sharper the verdict,
the more certain its facts must be") is about invented facts and misplaced blame, and those still
block. `FACTCHECK_SEVERITY=any` restores the old block-on-everything behaviour.

Failure semantics differ on purpose (rules 11, 14):
  · a BLOCKING finding                          -> the reel is BLOCKED (this is the point of the gate)
  · only MINOR findings                         -> logged loudly, and the reel proceeds
  · the checker ITSELF errors or is out of quota -> logged, and the reel proceeds
A grounding outage must not silently halt the day's batch; only a real verdict may.

_PROMPT = """You are the last check before a news script is published to millions of people. \
Your job is to stop FABRICATION — not to police precision.

SCRIPT TO CHECK:
{body}

SOURCES THE WRITER CLAIMS TO HAVE USED:
{sources}

Method — follow it exactly:
1. Extract every LOAD-BEARING factual claim: things that happened, numbers, dates, names, \
attributions, causal statements ("X caused Y"), and any statement assigning responsibility.
2. Use web search to check each claim independently. Do NOT assume the script or its source list \
is correct — the sources may not say what the writer thinks they say.
3. Sort EVERY problem you find into exactly one of the two buckets below. This is not optional: \
a problem you cannot place in "blocking" belongs in "minor".

BLOCKING — publishing this would mean publishing something FALSE. Only these:
· The event, action or ruling did not happen at all, or did not happen as described.
· A named person or organisation is credited or blamed for something they did not do.
· An invented quote, product, law, court ruling, report or statistic — something that does not \
exist.
· A number wrong by enough to change the conclusion: wrong order of magnitude, wrong direction \
(rose vs fell), or off by more than about a quarter.
· A blame or causation claim that NO source supports — not a weakly supported one, an \
unsupported one.

MINOR — real imperfections that do NOT justify killing the story. Everything else, including:
· Rounding, approximation, or a figure that differs because sources count it differently.
· A date off by a few days when the event itself is real.
· Wording, emphasis, or a claim stated more confidently than you would state it.
· A claim you could not independently confirm but that nothing contradicts.
· Sources that disagree with each other.
· A detail that is not load-bearing — remove it and the story still stands.

Two rules decide most cases:
· CONTRADICTION blocks; NON-CONFIRMATION does not. "I could not find this" is MINOR. "I found \
that this is false" is BLOCKING. One search pass missing a real story is common and is not \
evidence that the story is false.
· Two sources disagreeing does not make the script wrong. Both can be wrong, both can be right, \
or they can be measuring different things. Block only when the WEIGHT of the evidence \
contradicts the script — not when it merely fails to line up exactly.

NOT your concern: tone, sarcasm, opinion, or whether the take is harsh. A sharply worded verdict \
that the evidence supports is FINE. You are checking facts, not manners.

Calibrate: most scripts should pass. If your only objections are precision, phrasing or \
confidence, the verdict is "pass" and every item goes in "minor".

Return ONLY a JSON object, no markdown fences:
{{"checked": <how many claims you examined>, "blocking": ["the exact claim, and what contradicts \
it"], "minor": ["the exact claim, and what is imprecise about it"], "verdict": "pass" or "fail"}}
"verdict" is "fail" if and only if "blocking" is non-empty. Both lists may be empty.
