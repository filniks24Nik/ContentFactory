"""Orchestrator — the daily production pipeline (Module 10 in docs/02 §10).

Contract:
    what it does : for each approved idea, runs script -> voice -> visuals -> assemble ->
                   subtitle -> publish -> record -> cleanup. One reel failing is logged and
                   skipped; the batch continues (rule 14: fail soft on runtime).
    how to use   : `python -m src.production` (invoked by .github/workflows/production.yml).
    depends on   : all src modules + src.config.

On run: validate config, then bootstrap ideas+digest if the queue is dry (fallback ideation,
rule 11/12), drain any Telegram approvals (best-effort), and produce the approved queue.
Idempotent — produced ideas are skipped and already-published scripts never re-upload (rule 12).

STATUS: wired last, after every module passed in isolation (rule 7).
