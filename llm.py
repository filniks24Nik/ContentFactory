    depends on   : google-genai, groq, requests, src.config (GEMINI_API_KEY, GROQ_API_KEY).

Used by the scriptwriter (Module 3) and the ideation fallback. NOT used for Claude —
Claude ideation runs only in the Routine (rule 4). Respect free-tier quotas (rule 13).

Optional third provider: **GitHub Models** — ⚠️ **RETIRED BY GITHUB** (HTTP 410
`github_models_retirement_brownout`, verified 2026-09-01). Still opt-in via ENABLE_GH_MODELS /
PREFER_GH_MODELS and still fails over cleanly, but it can no longer answer, so rule 11's THIRD
link does not currently exist: the live chain is Gemini ↔ Groq only.

SDK note: uses the current **google-genai** SDK (`from google import genai`), not the
deprecated `google-generativeai`. Models are overridable via env (GEMINI_MODEL/GROQ_MODEL)
so we can swap free-tier models without a code change.

#     while gemini-2.5-flash was returning `limit: 20 ... model: gemini-2.5-flash`. Free quota is
#     metered PER MODEL, so each newer model carries its own untouched daily budget, and 3.6 Flash
#     is a straight quality upgrade over 2.5 Flash for scripts and hooks.
#   · grounded    — Google Search grounding 429s on EVERY 3.x model with an empty quota-violation
#     list (the signature of no free allowance), while gemini-2.5-flash 429s with an explicit
#     `limit: 20`, i.e. a real budget that was merely spent. **gemini-2.5-flash is still the only
#     model with free grounded search**, so grounding stays pinned to it.
#
# Keeping these on one knob was a live footgun: `_gen_gemini_grounded` defaulted to GEMINI_MODEL,

# `gemini-2.5-flash` 404s with "no longer available to new users" on a fresh key while still
# serving the original project, and every other model 429s with no allowance on BOTH keys. So
# the 20/day on this one project is the entire grounded budget the pipeline will ever have for
