"""Module 4 — Voice (narration).

Contract:
    what it does : synthesizes narration audio from a script body.
    input        : script_body (str); output dir.
    output       : (audio_path, duration_seconds).
    depends on   : Gemini Developer API TTS → Google Cloud TTS (Chirp 3 HD) → edge-tts → Kokoro
                   (rule 11: every engine has a fallback behind it).

Default engine is **Gemini TTS** on the free `gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview` model, voice
**Zubenelgenubi** ("Casual") — chosen by ear because it carries dry sarcasm, which is the
channel's whole register. The model was picked the same way on 2026-08-07: the operator ranked
3.1-flash > 2.5-flash > Chirp on an identical script. That ranking is also the order this module
degrades in, which is the only reason a *preview* model is safe as the default — a 503 lands on
the second-favourite sound, not on a surprise. The chain then falls through to Chirp 3 HD,
edge-tts and Kokoro, resolved by name at call time so a missing key or a withdrawn preview model
just advances a link. Pick the primary via VOICE_ENGINE (gemini|google|edge|kokoro).

**Expressive delivery is per-engine**, because the control signals are not portable:
  · `gemini`  — promptable: honours VOICE_STYLE_PROMPT *and* inline style tags ([sarcastic]).
                Free tier is metered per model: 3 RPM / 10 RPD (measured 2026-07-27), so it
                cannot starve the grounded ideation that shares the same API key.
  · `google`  — Chirp 3 HD reads `[pause]` tags, but only through its `markup` input field,
                and supports GOOGLE_TTS_SPEAKING_RATE.
  · `edge`/`kokoro` — no tag support at all; every tag is stripped before synthesis.
So each engine filters the script body itself rather than being handed pre-stripped text.

Kokoro's int8 model (~120 MB) auto-downloads once to KOKORO_CACHE; its voice/speed come from
KOKORO_VOICE/KOKORO_SPEED, edge-tts from VOICE/VOICE_RATE.

The local file is a render artifact: produce it here, let assembly/publish consume it, then
delete it (rule 15 — never store video/audio in Supabase).

# Curated, NOT exhaustive — the docs list ~16 common tags and note the real set is open-ended, but
# an allow-list of "whatever the model might accept" is not an allow-list. Two filters applied:
#
#   · REGISTER — this channel is deadpan; STATUS 2026-07-27 records that its failure mode is "a
#     narrator who announces the joke". So [excited], [amazed] and [giggles] are excluded as hype
#     even though they are documented and would work.
#   · RULE 6 — [crying], [panicked], [trembling], [gasp] and [shouting] are excluded outright.
#     Melodrama over real events is how a news channel drifts into tragedy exploitation.
#
# Undocumented but kept: deadpan/dry/amused/flat. Google's docs say the tag set is open-ended and
# to experiment; these four ARE the channel's core register and predate this list.
