# CLAUDE.md — AI Reel Factory ("But It Matters")

> **Read this first, every session.** It is the operating contract for any agent
> (cold or warm) working in this repo. Rules here **override** default behavior.

## What this project is

A near-zero-cost **autonomous content system** that publishes **4–5 captioned
YouTube Shorts per day**, requiring exactly **one human action daily**: approving
4–5 ideas via a Telegram "Morning Digest."

- **Channel:** *But It Matters* — daily impact news/info explainers (India + world), soft/positive lean.
- **Primary goal:** Reliably ship 4–5 captioned Shorts/day. **Consistency beats sophistication.**
- **Cost target:** **≤ $5/month** beyond the existing Claude Pro subscription (raised from $0 on 2026-06-15 to fund near-human voice; stay free-first — see rule 2).

## Onboarding (do this before working)

1. Read [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) — the live state of the build (what's done, what's next, blockers).
2. Read the docs **in order** (they are the source of truth):

   | # | Doc | Purpose |
   |---|-----|---------|
   | 1 | [docs/01-design-spec.md](docs/01-design-spec.md) | Architecture & decisions (the "why") |
   | 2 | [docs/02-implementation-plan.md](docs/02-implementation-plan.md) | Phase-1 MVP build, step by step |
   | 3 | [docs/03-setup-guide.md](docs/03-setup-guide.md) | Accounts + API keys to create first |
   | 4 | [docs/04-free-tools-reference.md](docs/04-free-tools-reference.md) | Every free tool, limits, links |
   | 5 | [docs/05-content-system.md](docs/05-content-system.md) | Templates + hook database |
   | 6 | [docs/06-roadmap.md](docs/06-roadmap.md) | The 5 phases, MVP → multi-niche scale |
   | 7 | [docs/07-architecture-diagram.md](docs/07-architecture-diagram.md) | Visual system + data flow |
   | 8 | [docs/08-news-niche-playbook.md](docs/08-news-niche-playbook.md) | **Niche compliance — non-negotiable** |

## The Rules

### A. Prime directives (always)

1. **Docs are living memory.** Before you finish any task, update [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)
   (what changed · what's next · blockers) and any doc your change affects. A cold agent —
   or future-you — must be able to resume from the markdown alone. If reality and the docs
   disagree, fix the docs.
2. **Free-first within a ≤ $5/month cap.** Default to free tools and the existing **Claude Pro**
   / **Google Gemini Pro** subscriptions. A small metered budget — **≤ $5/month total** (raised
   from $0 on 2026-06-15) — **may** be spent only where it meaningfully lifts quality. The one
   sanctioned billed service is **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech** (Chirp 3 HD voice; free at our
   volume — set a hard budget cap so it can never overrun). Any **new** billed service, or any
   spend that could exceed $5/month, is **stop-and-flag** — never sign up silently. (Rule 4's
   Claude-ToS boundary still holds absolutely.)
3. **Never self-attribute.** No `Co-Authored-By`, no "Generated with Claude Code," no AI
   credit anywhere — commits, PRs, code comments, or docs. *(This overrides default git
   behavior. Applies to this repo.)*

### B. Non-negotiable guardrails

4. **ToS boundary.** Claude ideation runs **only** via official Claude Code / Anthropic
   Routines. **Never** pipe `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` into custom Python or the Agent SDK —
   that is a Terms-of-Service violation. The free fallback uses the Gemini/Groq *developer*
   APIs, never Claude.
5. **Secrets hygiene.** Never commit real keys. Only `.env.example` (blank values) is
   committed. Real values live in a local `.env` (gitignored) and GitHub Actions secrets.
6. **News-niche compliance is the monetization gate** (see [docs/08](docs/08-news-niche-playbook.md)):
   - **Originality** — every reel adds analysis ("why it matters"), never a bare summary.
   - **AI disclosure** — set YouTube's synthetic-content flag + a description disclosure line.
   - **Copyright** — CC0 B-roll only (no broadcaster/agency footage); cut every 5–8s; own words + cite.
   - **Accuracy — truth over neutrality** (operator policy, 2026-07-27). ≥2 independent sources
     per claim. The channel **may reach a verdict and name who is responsible**; a well-sourced
     conclusion is not "taking a side", and the earlier "neutral framing" requirement is retired.
     The trade is strict and non-negotiable: **the sharper the verdict, the more certain its
     facts must be.** Enforced, not merely asked for — [`src/factcheck.py`](src/factcheck.py)
     re-checks every finished script against live search *before* it is voiced.
     **The gate stops fabrication, not imprecision** (severity grading, operator directive
     2026-08-07): the event not happening, the wrong party blamed, an invented quote/law/statistic,
     or a number wrong enough to flip the conclusion **blocks the reel**; rounding, a slightly
     different figure, a date off by a day, wording, and "couldn't confirm but nothing contradicts
     it" are logged and waived. **Contradiction blocks; non-confirmation does not** — one search
     pass missing a real story is routine, and two sources disagreeing is not proof the script is
     wrong (both can be wrong, both can be right, or they measure different things).
     `FACTCHECK_SEVERITY=any` restores block-on-every-discrepancy.
   - **Sensitivity filter still applies** — communal/religious incitement, anything that could
     inflame violence, rumour-as-fact, deepfakes, graphic tragedy exploitation, and medical or
     financial advice stated as fact remain excluded. Dropping the neutrality rule widened what
     may be *said*, not what may be *targeted*.

### C. How to build

7. **Module-by-module.** Each module has one purpose and a typed input→output contract. Get
   it working and tested **in isolation** before wiring the next. Modules communicate only
   through typed data (Supabase rows / function returns) — never shared globals.
8. **Verify before claiming done.** Run the check; show the evidence. Never assert "works"
   or "fixed" without proof. If tests fail or a step was skipped, say so plainly.
9. **Stay in the current phase (YAGNI).** Don't build Phase 2+ features early. A phase's exit
   criteria are the gate to the next one.
10. **Reproducible environment.** Pin dependency versions in `requirements.txt`. Document
    system deps (e.g. FFmpeg). A cold agent should be able to set up from the docs alone.

### D. Runtime reliability (this is a headless, free-tier, cron-driven system)

11. **Fallbacks are mandatory — the digest never dies.** Every external dependency has a
    fallback chain: ideation **Claude → Gemini → Groq**, voice **edge-tts → Kokoro**, visuals
    **Pexels → Pixabay**. A single upstream failure must never kill the daily run.
12. **Idempotent, safe reruns.** Cron can and will retry. Check Supabase state before acting —
    never double-publish, double-insert, or re-spend quota. Every step is safe to run twice.
13. **Quota & cost awareness.** Respect free-tier ceilings (YouTube ~100 uploads/day, Gemini
    ~1,500 req/day, Groq per-model limits, Supabase 500 MB DB). Log usage; alert via Telegram
    on a hard failure.
14. **Fail loud on misconfig, soft on runtime.** A missing required secret/env var = hard stop
    with a clear message (`config.py` fails loudly). One reel failing inside the daily batch =
    log it, skip it, keep the rest going.
15. **Environment reality.** Dev machine is **Windows 11 / PowerShell**. The pipeline runs on
    **GitHub Actions in UTC** — convert local times accordingly. **Asset policy:** render
    locally → upload → **delete the local file**. Never store video in Supabase.

### E. Product principles (from the design spec)

16. **Consistency > perfection.** Hooks > visuals · retention > followers · consistency >
    cinematic quality · use **templates**, not pure randomness · **keep the human approval
    layer** (AI still produces occasional cringe).

### F. Tooling

17. **Use Context7 for library/API docs.** When working with any library, framework, SDK, API,
    CLI, or cloud service, fetch current docs via Context7 MCP before relying on memory — your
    training data may lag recent changes.

### G. Git & versioning

18. **Versioning discipline.**
    - **Conventional commits:** `type(scope): summary` — e.g. `feat(voice): add edge-tts module`,
      `fix(publish): handle quota error`, `docs(status): log module 4 done`. Types: `feat`,
      `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`.
    - **Logically-grouped commits** — one coherent change each; no giant catch-all dumps.
    - **`CHANGELOG.md`** is kept current ([Keep a Changelog] style).
    - **Tag phase milestones:** `v0.1.0` = Phase-1 MVP done, `v0.2.0` = Phase 2, etc.
    - Keep [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) and the version in sync.
    - **Never force-push** shared history. Commit/push only when asked.
    - **No self-attribution in any commit or PR** (see rule 3).

## Current status

- **Phase:** 1 (MVP) — **built and live.** The full chain (ideation → Telegram approval →
  script → fact-check → voice → visuals → assembly → captions → YouTube) runs unattended; 76
  Shorts published as of 2026-09-03. Every module in [src/](src/) is implemented and tested.
- **Primary trigger is ON-DEMAND**, not cron: run the `make-short` workflow (or send
  `/makeshort` to the Telegram bot) and approve from the digest. `production.yml`'s schedule
  stays commented out on purpose.
- Always check [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for the authoritative, up-to-date state.
